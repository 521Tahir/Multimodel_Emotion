**What This Code Does (High-Level Summary)**
This Python code implements a multimodal emotion recognition system based on the paper “Can We Exploit All Datasets? Multimodal Emotion Recognition Using Cross-Modal Translation”. It processes audio, visual, and text modalities using transformers and uses a cross-modal translation module to augment missing modalities.

Key functionalities include:

Feature Extraction: Dummy and BERT-based extractors for audio, video, and text.

Modality-specific Transformers: Each modality (audio, visual, text) passes through its own transformer encoder.

Cross-Modal Translator: Uses GAN-style translator to synthesize missing modalities (e.g., generate audio from text).

Multimodal Fusion: Combines all modalities for final emotion classification.

Cycle Consistency Training: Translates modality A → B → A to ensure reconstruction fidelity.

Evaluation: Computes accuracy, F1 score, and plots confusion matrices.

**How the Code Was Built**
Dataset Integration:
In first step i integrate the both dataset .name of datatset are CMU-MOSEI and IEMOCAP datasets are loaded and merged.

Adds folder paths for audio and video subchunks.

Labels are encoded using LabelEncoder.

Feature Extractors:
Text: Uses BERT from HuggingFace to extract contextual embeddings.

Audio/Visual: Uses dummy extractors (torch.randn) as placeholders. In practice, these would use models like PANNs or FAN.

Architecture Modules:
Module	Purpose
ModalityTransformer	Processes sequential features per modality
MultimodalFusion	Concatenates and fuses the three modalities
EmotionClassifier	Wraps all modality transformers + fusion + classifier
CrossModalTranslator	GAN-style translator with encoder + decoder
Discriminator	Distinguishes real vs. fake features in GAN training

Training Strategy:
Jointly trains GAN translator and emotion classifier.

Alternates between classification loss and generator-discriminator adversarial losses.

Implements cycle consistency and sequence-level discrepancy using MSE.

Evaluation:
Computes classification accuracy and F1 score.

Supports dropout testing.

Compares real vs. generated input accuracy.
